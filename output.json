Toward this end, we provide computing support to the faculty, staff, and students of the CSE department, supporting over 3000 users each quarter. Our computing staff also design and build various software tools and hardware to support a unified computing environment. The CSE domain is divided into the instructional and research environment. The instructional environment is used primarily by faculty to teach courses, and students who are enrolled in CSE courses. The instructional environment consists of both a Windows and UNIX environment. Computers in the instructional environment are owned and administered by the CSE department, and include computers in the CSE computing labs, graduate TA and Fellow offices, and the faculty and staff offices. The research environment is used by faculty, post-doctorate researchers and graduate research assistants for supported research projects. Computers in the research environment are purchased by researchers with research funds, and are jointly administered by the researcher and department computing staff.

These requirements and the procedures for obtaining the degree are determined in part by the Graduate School, and in part by the Department. Petitions for exception to these requirements should be channeled through the departmental Graduate Studies Committee. Students in the M.S. program must be regular students as defined by the Graduate School regulations; special students and students enrolled in Continuing Education are not considered as regular students. In order to qualify for admission as regular students, students must first remove any restrictions placed on their status. Removal of restrictions is regulated by the Graduate School and the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee. The procedures and requirements described herein are subject to revision. Students should consult materials issued periodically by the Graduate School and the Department, their advisors, or the Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee for any changes or interpretation of policy. Program for the Master of Science Degree in CSE The program's philosophy is to provide students a broad graduate level education in the fundamentals of Computer Science and Engineering and also provide the opportunity for deeper study in a specialized sub-area of interest to the student. Students work out the details of their program in close consultation with their advisors. Two options are offered: Thesis Option (Research Track) Non-Thesis Option (Coursework Track) Program requirements for the Thesis Option and Non-Thesis Option are detailed in this document. The terms \"Research Track\" and \"Thesis Option\" are used interchangeably in this document. Similarly, the terms \"Coursework Track\" and \"Non-Thesis Option\" are used synonymously. 1 Advisors Students' degree programs and all courses taken by students must be approved by their academic advisors. Each student admitted to the graduate program in Computer Science and Engineering is assigned a tentative academic advisor. Students should consult their advisors as soon as possible after arriving on campus, and periodically thereafter until, upon developing a specific specialty interest, a permanent advisor is chosen in that specialty area. When a student determines that his/her interests lie in a particular specialty area, he/she should choose a permanent faculty advisor in that area. This choice should be made as soon as practical, especially for students planning either to undertake thesis research or to enter the Ph.D. program. Students whose specialty interests change should consider changing to an advisor whose field encompasses their new interests. In exceptional cases, members of other departments who hold joint appointments as Graduate Faculty members of this Department may serve as research advisors for students, but in all cases, the student's academic advisor must be a faculty member whose primary faculty appointment is in this Department. In addition to the above departmental academic and research advising, the Graduate School maintains a counseling office for students.  2 Requirements for the M.S. Degree in Computer Science and Engineering This section contains a list of requirements for the Master of Science Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Students are advised to check the latest edition of the Graduate School Handbook for possible added requirements. 2.1 Credits The minimum number of cr-hrs required for the M.S. Degree is as follows: Research Track (requires thesis): 30 cr-hrs Coursework Track (no thesis): 33 cr-hrs Students in either track must satisfy the course requirements listed in Sec. 2.2. 2.2 Degree Program Each candidate is required to pursue a program of study in courses approved by his/her academic advisor. Students in the thesis track need to complete 20 graded cr-hrs. Students in the non-thesis track need to complete 30 graded cr-hrs, or 24 graded cr-hrs and a masters project, as detailed in Section 2.4. For students in either track, at most 6 cr-hrs from classes taken outside of CSE may count towards these requirements. These classes must be from disciplines closely related to CSE, and need to be approved in advance by the student's advisor. For meeting the course requirements for both research and coursework track masters programs, letter-graded classes at the 5000-level and above will be considered to be of four types: Graduate Pre-Core: These classes include graduate versions of classes that are either required for the CSE undergrad degree or are in a \"pick-list\" in the requirements for the CSE undergrad degree. These graduate versions will typically be offered for fewer cr-hrs than the equivalent undergrad courses. The list currently includes CSE 5231, CSE 5232, CSE 5241, CSE 5321, CSE 5331, CSE 5341, CSE 5421, CSE 5431, CSE 5461, CSE 5521, and CSE 5541. Both non-thesis and thesis students are limited to taking at most 6 cr-hrs from this group, to count towards their 20/24/30 graded cr-hr requirements. Graduate Core: This group includes graduate classes (6xxx) on algorithms, computability and unsolvability, programming languages, computer architecture, and operating systems. All students must pass 3 foundational core classes, including algorithms, either computability and unsolvability or programming languages, and either computer architecture or operating systems. Applied Core: The classes currently in this list include (CSE 5242 or CSE5243), CSE 5343, CSE 5441, CSE 5462, (CSE 5522 or CSE5523), and (CSE 5542 or CSE 5544). Notice that only one of the classes in each set of parentheses can count toward the applied core requirement. If the second course within a set of parentheses is taken, it can count for an elective; but both courses within each set of parentheses cannot count as an applied core. Students in the thesis option must take at least one class from this group, and students in the non-thesis option must take at least two classes from this group. All other letter-graded classes offered by the CSE department at the 5000-level or above, or non-CSE graduate courses approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. These classes can be taken, together with the requirements and restrictions on pre-core, graduate core, and applied core, towards meeting the 20/24/30 graded cr-hr requirements. Students who are able to transfer graduate credit for these classes or who took equivalent courses as undergraduates may substitute other appropriate courses in their program, with the approval of their advisors. 2.3 Thesis Each student on the Research Track must submit an approved thesis, based on appropriate research experience, in accordance with Departmental and Graduate School regulations. The Master's thesis must be produced under the direction and with the approval of the student's research advisor, who must be a member of the Graduate Faculty. The Graduate School Handbook should be consulted for rules, procedures, and deadlines for preparation and submission of the final approved copy of the thesis. Each candidate (in either the Research Track or Coursework Track) must also pass a Master's Examination to test his/her knowledge of the course of study pursued. The rules governing the Master's Examination are given in Section 3. 2.4 Project Option Masters non-thesis students may take 6 S/U cr-hrs over two consecutive semesters to complete a substantial implementation project with a CSE faculty member. A 6-8 page write-up on the features of the software and the design choices made must be completed and approved by the CSE faculty member supervising the project. This write-up should be included with the masters paperwork for the student (please also see details of the masters examination for project option below). These 6 cr-hrs will count towards the 30 graded cr-hr requirements for non-thesis students. 2.5 Residency and Transfer Credit Satisfactory completion of 24 cr-hrs of graduate credit (Research Track), or 27 cr-hrs of graduate credit (Coursework Track), over a minimum of two semesters at this university, is required. Students who transfer cr-hrs from other departments or other universities in order to qualify for the degree, must submit their Request for Application or Transfer of Credit no later than the second semester of enrollment in the graduate school. 2.6 Academic Standards A graduate student must maintain at least a B (3.00) average in all graduate credit courses, with no more than one-third of the cr-hrs with grades of C or lower. Students whose performance falls below the above standard are subject to the Graduate School rules which apply to probationary status or dismissal. In addition, a graduate student must maintain at least a B (3.00) average in all courses applied towards the student's CSE degree. Only courses in which a graduate student has received a C (2.00) or higher may be applied to the student's CSE degree. 2.7 Application to Graduate and Declaration of Examination Forms Students must submit an \"Application to Graduate\" form to the department office by second Monday of the semester of expected graduation. For non-thesis option, a Declaration of Examination form with the Chair of the Department's M.S. Comprehensive Examination Committee by the eleventh week of the semester prior to the semester in which the degree is sought. These forms, and instructions for their use, are available in the Department office. Both forms require approval by the student's academic advisor before submission to the Department. Failure to submit these forms on time will usually result in the student not being able to graduate in the semester desired. No student will be allowed to take the Master's examination until he or she has received graduate credit for at least 16 cr-hrs at this university and reasonably can be expected to complete all of the requirements for the Master's degree in the semester for which the \"Application to Graduate\" form is filed. Students are expected, however to take the Master's examination by the time they have completed 33 cr-hrs. Any exceptions to this rule must be petitioned to the Graduate Studies Committee. 2.8 Time Limit The entire work for the Master's degree must be completed within a period of six calendar years. 3 Master's Examination A Master's Examination is required to test the candidate's knowledge of the courses of study he/she has pursued. Students must have filed an \"Application to Graduate\" form (Section 2.7) before they can take this examination. If a student fails to perform satisfactorily on the Master's Examination and desires to take it again in order to get the Master's degree, he/she must enroll the following semester for at least 3 cr-hrs and take the final examination in that semester. Any exceptions to this rule must have the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. In accordance with Graduate School regulations, no student will be permitted to take this examination a third time. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe the details concerning the format and scheduling of the Master's Examination for students on the Research Track and Coursework Track. 3.1 Research Track (Thesis Option) The Master's Examination is held after the draft of the thesis is approved. Final thesis approval occurs after the examination. The examination must be oral and may include a written portion, at the option of the examination committee. The chair of the committee is to be the candidate's research advisor, and the committee must include at least one other member of the committee who is a member of the Graduate Faculty with primary appointment in the CSE Department. The Graduate Studies Committee may appoint additional members of the committee if it considers it necessary. The committee chair is responsible for arranging and conducting the examination, which is to be based on the subject matter of the thesis as well as the course of study which the candidate has pursued. The chair of the examining committee is also responsible for certifying the examination results and reporting them to the Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate School office within the prescribed time set by the Graduate School. 3.2 Coursework Track (Non-Thesis Option) All candidates on the Coursework Track who do not finish a project must pass a written comprehensive examination composed of examinations in three of the five core areas, specifically, algorithms, either of computability and unsolvability or programming languages, and either of computer architecture or operating systems. Examination in each of the areas is of 120 minute duration, and these examinations are administered over a two day duration. Student who finish a project (described above), AND have a B average in the three core classes they are required to take, can take a masters examination based on their project. A masters examination based on project requires a committee with at least 2 CSE faculty members. This is an oral examination that should last at least 60 minutes, with time equally divided between the candidate's presentation and questioning from the committee. Students intending to take such an option need to finish a longer project report (at least 10 single spaced pages). 4 Master's Degree on Basis of Ph.D. Candidacy Examination Ph.D. students who have not previously obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering may be recommended for the Master of Science degree after taking their Ph.D.Candidacy Examinations under the following conditions: It is recommended by the student's advisor and the Graduate Studies Committee. The student does not already hold an equivalent master's degree in the same field. Graduation deadlines established by the Graduate School are met. The Graduate School Handbook is to be consulted for the applicable procedural details.

Due to limited availability, we consider applicants for associateships only if they are interested in pursuing a Ph.D., which they should communicate by marking 'Ph.D. only' track on the application. Similarly, the department recommends applicants to the graduate school for fellowships only if they mark 'Ph.D. only' track on their application. Once fellowship or associateship offers are made and availed, this track option cannot be changed. Associateships require approximately 20 hours per week in service to the department and allow a student to pursue approximately two thirds of a full-time academic schedule. Fellowships allow a student to pursue a full-time academic schedule. Fellowships include summer support. Students with Teaching Associateships are offered summer support, subject to availability. Numerous Teaching and Research Associateships are provided each year by the department and, normally, TA offers are made only for Autumn Quarter. Applicants to the graduate program who wish to be considered for an Associateship or Fellowship should indicate this in the appropriate section of the application form. Students whose native language is not English must demonstrate proficiency in spoken English. Without such a demonstration, students reduce their chances of getting Associateships and the awards are smaller.

BS CSE and BS CIS The BS CSE and the BS CIS programs prepare students for a range of careers in Computer Science. The Computer Science portion of these two programs are identical to each other. The main difference between the two is that the BS CSE requires more math, science, and engineering while the BS CIS requires more general education courses including a foreign language. BA CIS The BA CIS program through the College of Arts and Sciences, allows students considerable flexibility in tailoring the choice of courses, including Computer Science courses, according to their specific interests. This degree requires the student to identify a related field that offers a high potential for computing applications, and take several courses in the related field at both the introductory and advanced levels. This is offset by a somewhat lighter set of requirements in advanced computing courses. The General Education component of this program is similar to that of the BS CIS program. Alternatives If you have decided you would like to be in the computer science field but are looking for a different application, consider these alternatives: BS BA (Information Systems option) offered by the Fisher College of Business BS ECE (Computer Eng. specialization) offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Data Analytics (Computational Analytics Specialization) offered by the College of Arts and Sciences Department ofComputer Science and Engineering395 Dreese Laboratories2015 Neil AvenueColumbus, OH 43210-1277(614) 292-5813 Phone(614) 292-2911 Fax Support CSE Invest in a Buckeye \u0009Your gift will make a difference.

How do I take courses in the department? Ans: Probably the simplest approach would be for you to become a continuing education student at OSU. This will allow you to take courses offered by various OSU departments including this department. But note that CIS and CSE majors get priority scheduling for courses beyond CSE 2221 taught by the department. Other students are admitted on a space-available basis. Q: I have been a programmer/software developer for many years although I do not have an undergraduate degree in CS. I would like to get such a degree. What is the fastest way of doing so? Ans: There probably is no guaranteed quick way of getting such a degree, but there are different approaches. It is best to set up an appointment with an advisor to discuss the options you have. Please contact the Advising Office. You may also want to consider the possibility of getting into our graduate program. Q: I am a high-school senior and have been programming in C and C++ for 5 years. I am interested in becoming a professional video game software developer. How do I go about it? Ans: To become a good software engineer, whether it is in the field of video games or any other kind of software, a person needs a solid grounding in key concepts in programming and computing. Those concepts and skills are learned and developed in any of our bachelor degrees in the department. Note that mathematical skills and analytical thinking abilities are essential for success in software engineering; our programs, therefore, have a fairly strong math component as well. Q: I am a high-school senior and was planning to join OSU to major in one of the programs in this department. But I hear that all the IT jobs are going overseas. Should I change my plans? Ans: The philosophy of most career and academic counselors is to go for your passion. If you feel that computing is your passion, then go for it. There have been many studies that suggest the IT jobs are here to stay, but perhaps in a broader sector. And with the current state of the economy, the increase in job opportunities means companies will be starting to hire, and the IT sector will not produce enough students to fill necessary jobs. Some of the fastest-growing occupations nationally by percentage are IT related: Network system, data analysts, software engineers. And in the state of Ohio, various types of IT jobs were in the top 7 out of 10 jobs that are the fastest-growing occupations by percentage. Change your plans? Only you can answer that, but if you really enjoy computing, you should definitely consider pursuing a computing degree. Q: I am a student in University of XYZ. I want to transfer to Ohio State so I can work in computer animation. What should I do? Ans: If you are an undergraduate student, see the admissions page. If you are a graduate student, see the graduate program page. Q: I am a high-school senior and will be joining OSU in the fall. How long will it take for me to complete my CSE (or CIS) degree? Ans: Depends on a number of factors such as how many credit hours you will be taking each semester, how many/which prerequisite courses you might have to take at OSU, etc. In the past few years, the average time-to-degree for both BS CSE and BS CIS majors has been 4 to 5 years. BA CIS students typically take somewhat shorter time but the number of these students is so low that averages don't make sense.  Department ofComputer Science and Engineering395 Dreese Laboratories2015 Neil AvenueColumbus, OH 43210-1277(614) 292-5813 Phone(614) 292-2911 Fax Support CSE Invest in a Buckeye \u0009Your gift will make a difference.

They entered spring training as the favorites and delivered, winning 103 regular-season games and then coming back from 3-1 down against the Cleveland Indians to win their first World Series title since 1908.Editor's Picks2016 MLB postseason: Complete coverageIt was the Cubs' year after all! So how did they break their 108-year drought? Here's a look back at baseball's historic 2016 postseason.But that's old news! The other 29 teams are already looking ahead to 2017. The offseason has barely started and free agency and trades will have an impact, but here are our too-early rankings for 2017. FYI, I had the Cubs first and the Indians seventh on this list a year ago. Just don't ask me where I had the Diamondbacks.2016 rankings: Week 26 | Week 25 | Week 24 | Week 23 | Week 22 | Week 21 | Week 20 | Week 19 | Week 18 | Week 17 | Week 16 | Week 15 | Week 14 | Week 13 | Week 12 | Week 11 | Week 10 |  Week 9 | Week 8 | Week 7 | Week 6 | Week 5 | Week 4 | Week 3 | Week 2 | Week 1 | Preseason1. Chicago Cubs2016 record: 103-58-1 Final ranking: No. 1With a core of young position player stars -- they had the fourth-youngest group of hitters in the majors as weighted by playing time -- the question isn't why the Cubs are No. 1, but what could go wrong that would prevent them for holding this spot for several years to come? I guess the rotation could fall apart -- Jake Arrieta leaves as a free agent after 2017, Jon Lester gets hurt, Kyle Hendricks goes back to being a mid-rotation starter -- but the Cubs have the resources to fix that if necessary. Aroldis Chapman and Dexter Fowler (assuming he declines his option) are the only major free agents, and Theo Epstein will have to sort out a crowded outfield, but I see them winning 100-plus games again.2. Boston Red Sox2016 record: 93-69 Final ranking: No. 2Like the Cubs, the Red Sox have a young group of position players, the safest type of player to project moving forward. Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts will be entering their age-24 seasons, and Andrew Benintendi and Yoan Moncada look like two more young stars in the making. They'll have to replace David Ortiz, but designated hitter is the one area of strength in free agency with Edwin Encarnacion, Jose Bautista, Mark Trumbo and Carlos Beltran available. The rotation again will feature David Price and Rick Porcello, and Eduardo Rodriguez has breakout potential.3. Washington Nationals2016 record: 95-67 Final ranking: No. 5There are some concerns here -- Stephen Strasburg's health, Ryan Zimmerman's dead bat, Jayson Werth's age, replacing or re-signing Wilson Ramos (who tore his ACL in late September) -- but with a full season from Trea Turner, better numbers from Bryce Harper and plenty of rotation depth, the Nationals should return to the playoffs, where they've lost in the division series three times in five years.4. Los Angeles Dodgers2016 record: 91-71 Final ranking: No. 4Look, I don't like the bloated payroll full of expensive, injury-prone starting pitchers, either, but it's not our money being flushed down Chavez Ravine. They still have the best pitcher in the game in Clayton Kershaw, Kenta Maeda is solid and youngsters Julio Urias and Jose De Leon have star potential. And that's aside from whatever Scott Kazmir, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Brandon McCarthy have to offer. As we saw in the playoffs, adding some right-handed bats and re-signing Justin Turner and Kenley Jansen will be top priorities.5. Cleveland Indians2016 record: 94-67 Final ranking: No. 6Assuming Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar return to health, the Indians could run away with the American League Central again, given the unknown direction of the Tigers and the shaky state of the Royals. Remember, they'll still have Andrew Miller and will hopefully get Michael Brantley back in the outfield to go along with rising superstar Francisco Lindor. Mike Napoli is the major free agent, coming off a 34-homer season.6. Houston Astros2016 record: 84-78 Final ranking: No. 15The Astros never quite recovered from a 7-17 April that put them in a big hole. They had the youngest group of position players in the majors, however, and will be adding Alex Bregman for a full season. Carlos Correa didn't put up the MVP numbers many expected, but he'll be better and may do that in 2017. They'll need a bounce-back from Dallas Keuchel, health from Lance McCullers and better production from first base. Adding a lefty bat or two would help balance out the lineup.7. San Francisco Giants2016 record: 87-75 Final ranking: No. 10They need to figure out what happened to the offense in the second half, and they'll have to find some stability in the ninth inning (Jansen? Chapman?), but any team that starts with Madison Bumgarner, Johnny Cueto, Jeff Samardzija and Matt Moore should be competitive. Depth is an issue, and Bumgarner, Cueto and Samardzija were all worked hard in 2016. A power-hitting left fielder who bats right-handed would fill a need. Hmm, sounds a lot like Yoenis Cespedes.8. Pittsburgh Pirates2016 record: 78-83-1 Final ranking: No. 17Almost every year, at least one playoff team finished under .500 the season before -- and usually more than one team. In 2016, that was the Red Sox; in 2015., there were four such teams. The Pirates fit the bill after a down season. They fell from third in the National League in runs allowed to ninth, as the rotation fell apart. No starter made more than 21 starts, always a recipe for disaster. They just need Gerrit Cole to return to ace status and Jameson Taillon and Tyler Glasnow to reach their potential. Re-signing Ivan Nova -- 52 strikeouts and three walks after joining the Pirates -- is another key. The big question looming: Trade Andrew McCutchen and play Austin Meadows? Or move McCutchen to left field and hope he bounces back?9. Texas Rangers2016 record: 95-67 Final ranking: No. 3The Rangers won 95 games while somehow outperforming their BaseRuns win total by 13 victories. That's because they went 36-11 in one-run games, the best winning percentage ever, and that's not going to happen again, so they'll have to improve just to get back to 90 wins. That can happen with full seasons from Yu Darvish and Jonathan Lucroy, improvement from Rougned Odor and Nomar Mazara and the addition of another starter like Rich Hill.10. St. Louis Cardinals2016 record: 86-76 Final ranking: No. 12The Cardinals are always a safe bet to contend. They've won at least 86 games each of the past nine seasons and have just one sub-.500 season in the past 17, a stretch that includes 12 playoff trips. They struggled defensively in 2016 as Mike Matheny never seemed to settle on the right defensive rotation and the starters -- other than Carlos Martinez -- collapsed after a great 2015. In the past, the Cardinals have been able to contend simply aiming for 90 wins. The growth of the Cubs means they need to aim higher.11. Seattle Mariners2016 record: 86-76 Final ranking: No. 13The Mariners could go either direction. They had the oldest lineup in the AL and you can't expect Robinson Cano and Nelson Cruz to combine for 82 home runs again. Felix Hernandez is no longer an ace and Hisashi Iwakuma will turn 36. They also won 86 games despite some glaring problems, most notably a bullpen that lost nine games the Mariners were leading heading into the ninth. Edwin Diaz seemed to fix that problem, however, and James Paxton and Taijuan Walker (after a late-season mechanical change) teased once again.12. Toronto Blue Jays2016 record: 89-73 Final ranking: No. 8With Encarnacion and Bautista possibly leaving, and given the ages of Troy Tulowitzki and Russell Martin, I've seen suggestions that the Jays may have missed their window and should consider rebuilding. That seems a little absurd given they'll bring back the AL's top rotation. Aaron Sanchez led the AL in ERA in his first full season as a starter and Marco Estrada's BABIP ability is clearly the real deal. OK, maybe J.A. Happ doesn't win 20 games again and the offense needs to find support for Josh Donaldson, but the Jays have deep pockets to fix some holes.13. Colorado Rockies2016 record: 75-87 Final ranking: No. 20Sure, they could turn into the 2017 version of the Diamondbacks, but the Rockies have the talent to end their skid of six straight losing seasons. I would not trade Carlos Gonzalez -- an outfield of CarGo, David Dahl and Charlie Blackmon would be too much fun -- in part because the Rockies always overestimate their offense. They had their best season in a long time on the road but were still just 22nd in the majors in runs. They need to fix a horrific bullpen that had the worst ERA in the majors; even factoring in Coors Field, a 5.13 mark is unacceptable.14. New York Mets2016 record: 87-75 Final ranking: No. 9Winning 87 games and a wild-card spot was a minor miracle given only two regulars played 140 games and the rotation was decimated by injuries down the stretch. Aside from health, however, there are some red flags here. Bartolo Colon will be 44 if he's re-signed. Cespedes will almost certainly leave, and while Jay Bruce has a team option, he's not that good. Michael Conforto's fast track to stardom had some bumps. The rotation, of course, could carry the Mets to 90-plus wins, but we know the precarious nature of young arms.15. New York Yankees2016 record: 84-78 Final ranking: No. 14Bring on the youngsters! Aaron Judge, Clint Frazier and Greg Bird should all be incorporated into the 2017 lineup, although I envision some growing pains for Judge and Frazier. Then there's Gary Sanchez, who was arguably the best player in baseball the final two months. There are rumors they'll look to re-sign Chapman to form a 1-2 punch with Dellin Betances, and they'll need to find another starter or two.16. Kansas City Royals2016 record: 81-81 Final ranking: No. 16This looks like the last hurrah for this group of players: Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Lorenzo Cain, Alcides Escobar, Jarrod Dyson, Danny Duffy and Wade Davis are all free agents after 2017. Kendrys Morales has a mutual option for 2017 as well. The Royals were in first place through the end of May, and while injuries to Moustakas and Cain hurt, mostly they just weren't that good. They were last in the AL in home runs and 13th in OBP. They'll need better work from Edinson Volquez and Yordano Ventura and better numbers from Alex Gordon.17. Detroit TigersRecord: 86-75 Week 25 ranking: No. 11It will be interesting to see what the Tigers end up doing this offseason after general manager Al Avila said \"changes are coming.\" If the aging core of stars -- Miguel Cabrera, Ian Kinsler, Victor Martinez, Justin Verlander -- wasn't good enough to make the playoffs in 2016 in a weak division, what are the odds the Tigers will get there in 2017?18. Atlanta Braves2016 record: 68-93 Final ranking: No. 24The Braves finished next to last in the National League in runs, but here's a fun fact to amaze your friends with: Over the final two months they ranked fourth in the majors in runs and the team went 31-25. That certainly provides hope for 2017, and while I'm not quite as optimistic as Braves fans, young pitching can mature in a hurry. And if Mike Foltynewicz, Matt Wisler turn the corner, the Braves could surprise.19. Baltimore Orioles2106 record: 89-73 Final ranking: No. 7If you think this is pessimistic, just wait and see what the computers project for the O's. Of course, the computers always aim low on the Orioles and, hey, Zach Britton may actually blow a save or two in 2017. The concerns: The team relied on mashing 253 home runs, but 47-homer guy Trumbo is a free agent; they may not extend a qualifying offer to Matt Wieters and hand catcher over to rookie Chance Sisco, and Adam Jones had a subpar OPS+ of 95 (below league average). And who's in the rotation after Kevin Gausman and Chris Tillman?20. Arizona DiamondbacksRecord: 69-93 Week 25 ranking: No. 28OK, 2016 was a complete disaster, a 93-loss season that resulted in the firing of GM Dave Stewart and manager Chip Hale and the demotion of Tony La Russa. But there's talent here in Paul Goldschmidt, Zack Greinke, Jake Lamb, Jean Segura and others. Robbie Ray had a 4.90 ERA but was second in the majors in K's per nine (11.25). If A.J. Pollock comes back from his broken elbow and Shelby Miller finds himself, the D-backs are a deep sleeper.21. Los Angeles Angels2016 record: 74-88 Final ranking: No. 21Are the Angels wasting the best years of Mike Trout's career? Well, they're certainly going backward, from 98 wins in 2014 to 85 to 74. There aren't any reinforcements coming up on the farm, but if Garrett Richards' elbow can hold up that will help a rotation decimated by injuries. C.J. Wilson and Jered Weaver are free agents, so that clears $40 million off the payroll to spend in a weak free-agent market.22. Milwaukee Brewers2016 record: 73-89 Final ranking: No. 22I like the direction the Brewers are going. Jonathan Villar came out of nowhere to become one of the league's most exciting players, Zach Davies proved himself in the rotation and Tyler Thornburg developed into a closer with 90 K's in 67 innings. The farm system is highly rated after some of the in-season trades and could get even deeper if Ryan Braun is traded. They're not ready to contend in 2017, but get this: Other than Braun, only Matt Garza makes big money and he's gone after 2017. Not only will they have a young core, they'll have money to spend in free agency, probably in 2018 and 2019.23. Miami Marlins2016 record: 79-82 Final ranking: No. 18The Marlins finished three games under .500 but were 10 games under in games Jose Fernandez didn't start. His death obviously leaves a gaping hole in a rotation that was already thin. Look, if Dee Gordon and Giancarlo Stanton have better seasons there is reason to believe, but it's also a team with a management that lacks the creativity and financial willpower to make the necessary upgrades. A bad farm system makes it even more likely the Marlins remain stuck in mediocrity.24. Tampa Bay Rays2016 record: 68-94 Final ranking: No. 28The Rays' pitching strategy in recent years had been to develop or acquire fly ball pitchers, who generally give up a lower BABIP and have higher strikeout rates. As home runs soared in 2016, this strategy was crushed: Their pitchers allowed 35 more runs than in 2015. The offense, meanwhile, hit 216 home runs, but ranked next to last in the AL in OBP. They need to find a catcher who can hit and they hope Matt Duffy shores up defense at shortstop as Brad Miller moves to first base, but this comes down to Chris Archer and Drew Smyly having better seasons and Blake Snell developing as expected.25. Chicago White Sox2016 record: 78-84 Final ranking: No. 19Do they rebuild? Doesn't it seem that four straight losing seasons is a sign this group as constructed isn't good enough? So you have to assume everybody is potentially on the board, including Chris Sale.26. Philadelphia Phillies2016 record: 71-91 Final ranking: No. 23Are Aaron Nola, Vince Velasquez, Jerad Eickhoff and Jake Thompson the core of a future playoff rotation? All four had good moments in 2016, but Nola finished the year on the DL, Velasquez had a 5.33 ERA in the second half, Eickhoff gave up 30 home runs, and Thompson had a 32/28 SO/BB ratio in his 10-start debut. The Phillies need that group to develop because the lineup is still a work in progress.27. Oakland Athletics2016 record: 69-93 Final ranking: No. 26I think Billy Beane would love to turn the clock back to the eighth inning of the 2014 wild-card game to see how history unfolds if Bob Melvin has a quicker hook with Jon Lester.28. Cincinnati Reds2016 record: 68-94 Final ranking: No. 27They did go 36-37 in the second half after a 32-57 first half. Some of that was due to Joey Votto's monster second half, but the pitching staff also lowered its ERA from 5.47 to 4.22. The bullpen was a wreck, serving up 103 home runs, the most in MLB history. Amir Garrett and Robert Stephenson could provide a boost to the rotation at some point, and Billy Hamilton's .369 OBP in the second half provides some hope, but the Reds remain a long way off.29. Minnesota Twins2016 record: 59-103 Final ranking: No. 30The Twins predictably regressed from their lucky 2015 campaign -- but nobody expected them to regress all the way back to 103 losses. Miguel Sano struck out 178 times in 116 games; Jose Berrios had an 8.02 ERA in 14 starts; Byron Buxton struggled out of the gate (although did post an .812 OPS over his final 44 games). Even if those three improve, however, there are still big problems in a pitching staff that -- remarkably -- allowed 128 more runs than the next-worst AL team.30. San Diego Padres2016 record: 68-94 Final ranking: No. 25Imagine a team with Corey Kluber, Anthony Rizzo, Trea Turner, Joe Ross, Yasmani Grandal, Brad Brach, and Logan Forsythe. Now imagine the 2017 Padres.

{"_id":{"$oid":"582f039e208ce3287d510876"},"document":"MLB Daily Lines - Friday, November 18 More Daily Lines NFL MLB NBA NHL NCAA Football NCAAM Basketball  PickCenter » ESPN Chalk » Powered by Odds Shark Daily LinesWestgatePinnacleSports.com5Dimes.euBOVADA.lvBETONLINE.agSportsBetting.agDaily lines are currently unavailable. Glossary Total: Also known as over-under odds, this involves predicting how many runs will be scored in the game by both teams combined. Baseball totals usually range from 6.5 (when two aces are pitching) to 11.5 or 12 (for games involving high-scoring teams or when weak starting pitchers are involved). When you see 9.5, you are hoping for 10 or more runs if you bet over and hoping for 9 or less if you bet under. Where you see a moneyline value attached to the 9.5, this is the risk-reward amounts (vig or juice) for selecting the over or the under. So if you see 9.5, u-110, that means the total is 9.5 runs and you have to risk $110 (-110) in order bet the under (u indicates under). If the final score is 5-3, the total is 8 which is under 9.5 and you pocket $100. There are values for the over like 9.5, o+105. Here, you profit $105 (+105) by risking $100 if the game ends 7-3 (as 10 is more than 9.5 total runs). Money Line: Most wagering in baseball happens on the moneyline, which replaces the point spread because most games are low-scoring 3-2 games. The team you pick has to win the game, not win by a certain number of runs (or points like in basketball or football). You will see negative values (-150) and positive values (+130) and these refer to favorites and underdogs. Picture the number 100 sitting between these two values. Example: if you want to back a -150 favorite, you would wager $150 to win $100. On a +130 underdog, you would lay $100 and win $130 if the underdog wins. You have to risk a bit more to back the favorite and you get a higher payout by backing the underdog. Run Line: This is identical to a puckline in hockey and serves as a combo of moneyline and point spread. A team must win by two or more runs in order to win the wager. The negative value -1.5 shows a team favored by 1.5 runs. The positive value +1.5 indicates that team is the underdog by 1.5 runs. Picking the fave means the team must win by at least two runs to cover the runline spread (4-2 wins, 3-2 loses). The underdog team can lose by one run and still cover the spread. You may see -115 or +150 value connected to the runline. This is the moneyline part and indicates how much you need to risk and how much you will profit. Example: if a team is -1.5, +145 and you wagered $100, that means you would profit $145 (+125) if the team wins by two runs or more. On the other side, a team that is +1.5, -170, you would have to risk $170 (-170) to back the team. If they win the game or only lose by a single run, you have a winning wager of $100.

Using a 0-to-10 scale, our experts evaluated the players based on how well they are projected to perform in 2016.

Mike TroutBrace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty ImagesPos.: CF | Team: Los Angeles Angels2015 rank: 1 | 2016 fantasy rank: 12015 stats: .299 BA, .991 OPS, 41 HRs, 90 RBIsESPN says: Here's a scary thought for American League pitchers: What if Trout is getting better? In his first three seasons, Trout struggled against high fastballs, hitting only .146 with six home runs. Last year, he hit .209 with five home runs against such pitches. Those numbers won't blow you away, but what if the game's best player can erase the major weakness in his game? Then factor in that he cut his strikeout rate from 2014 (when he led the AL in whiffs). Trout hit 41 home runs in 2015, and that was with only one in August, when he played through a wrist injury. Don't be surprised if he hits 50 this season while still doing all the other things -- defense, walks, baserunning, durability -- that make him the No. 1 player in the BBTN100. -- David Schoenfield, ESPN.com Sweetspot bloggerBy the numbers: Since Trout debuted in 2011, he leads all players with 37.9 WAR. Further, that 37.9 WAR through Trout's age-23 season are the most by a player in the modern era. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information2. Bryce HarperPatrick McDermott/Washington Nationals/Getty ImagesPos.: RF | Team: Washington Nationals | @Bharper34072015 rank: 34 | 2016 fantasy rank: 42015 stats: .330 BA, 1.109 OPS, 42 HRs, 99 RBIsEditor's PicksNext year's No. 1? Don't be surprised if it's Bryce Harper, not Mike TroutOnce again, Mike Trout is No. 1 in our BBTN 100 rankings. But Bryce Harper is hot on his heels -- and after 2016, it could be a whole new ballgame.ESPN says: As good as Harper was in 2015, when he became the youngest unanimous MVP in baseball history, there's plenty of reason to expect him to be even better this season. The obvious? He's another year older. The not so obvious? Offensively, he should have more protection than he did last season, when he produced historic numbers despite the limited presence of cleanup hitter Ryan Zimmerman, who was hampered by injuries and missed 67 games. Defensively, Harper is only going to improve in right field, where last year, in his first full season playing the position, he was already good enough to be named a Gold Glove finalist. Add it all up, and Harper could be MLB's next back-to-back MVP. -- Eddie Matz, ESPN.com Nationals/Orioles reporterBy the numbers: Harper finally displayed his prodigious tools last season, as he led the National League in runs (118) and home runs (42) while leading MLB in OBP (.460) and slugging percentage (.649). -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information3. Clayton KershawJim McIsaac/Getty ImagesPos.: LHP | Team: Los Angeles Dodgers | @ClaytonKersh222015 rank: 2 | 2016 fantasy rank: 32015 stats: 33 GS, 16-7, 2.13 ERA, 301 KsESPN says: His uniform top always seems askew, one jersey sleeve perpetually appears shorter than the other, and he looks to be doing yoga when pitching out of the stretch. But judging this book by its cover would be the worst mistake of your life. Everything from Kershaw's blazing fastball to his rainbow curveball comes from the same release point, which is challenging in its own right. But the lefty can take off pace from even his off-speed stuff, which means he can go through an entire inning without throwing the same pitch twice, if he so desires. Not too many pitchers seem to be a no-hitter waiting to happen every time they take the mound. This is one of those once-in-a-generation guys. How far out do they take hotel reservations in Cooperstown? Asking for Kershaw's family. -- Doug Padilla, ESPN.com Dodgers reporterBy the numbers: Kershaw has 1,746 strikeouts in 1,611 career innings pitched, which makes him one of six pitchers with 1,500 IP and more strikeouts than innings. The other five are Tim Lincecum, Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson, Nolan Ryan and Sandy Koufax. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information4. Paul GoldschmidtChristian Petersen/Getty ImagesPos.: 1B | Team: Arizona Diamondbacks2015 rank: 9 | 2016 fantasy rank: 22015 stats: .321 BA, 1.005 OPS, 33 HRs, 110 RBIsESPN says: The only thing Goldschmidt doesn't do well is self-promote. Since 2013, he has made three straight All-Star appearances, finished second in the NL MVP balloting twice and won two Gold Gloves and a pair of Silver Slugger awards. New staff ace Zack Greinke will attract the bulk of the attention in Arizona this season because of his massive contract, but if the Diamondbacks are going to live up to the hype and make the postseason, Goldschmidt could just as easily be the guy who leads the way. -- Jerry Crasnick, ESPN.com senior writerBy the numbers: Goldschmidt is hitting .309 with a .412 OBP and a .556 slugging percentage the past three seasons. Mike Trout and Miguel Cabrera are the only other players to hit .300/.400/.550 combined in that span. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information5. Andrew McCutchenStacy Revere/Getty ImagesPos.: CF | Team: Pittsburgh Pirates | @TheCUTCH222015 rank: 3 | 2016 fantasy rank: 72015 stats: .292 BA, .889 OPS, 23 HRs, 96 RBIsESPN says:  Coming up on his age-29 season, the former 2013 National League MVP is still in the middle of his prime. He's delivered five straight seasons with 60 or more extra-base hits. It's interesting to note that, at this stage of his career, the player Cutch most closely resembles, according to Bill James' Similarity Scores, is Andre Dawson. Imagine the future Hall of Famer never losing his wheels to Montreal's tough turf and you get a hint of how special McCutchen has been and will continue to be, especially considering his durability -- he's landed on the DL just once in his career. Although he may have lost a step in center, he's a franchise player, and still Pirates property for the next two seasons -- almost certainly three once they pick up a club option for 2018. -- Christina Kahrl, ESPN.com editor/Sweetspot bloggerBy the numbers: McCutchen has finished in the top five in the National League MVP voting in each of the past four years, and he won the award in 2013. His .313 batting average since 2012 puts him third in the majors, behind Miguel Cabrera and Buster Posey. He has 207 multihit games the past four seasons -- 19 more than the next player (Posey). McCutchen also has 26.4 WAR in that span, which ranks second to only Mike Trout among position players. McCutchen has won four straight Silver Slugger awards and has been selected to as many consecutive All-Star teams. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information6. Zack GreinkeChristian Petersen/Getty ImagesPos.: RHP | Team: Arizona Diamondbacks2015 rank: 29 | 2016 fantasy rank: 622015 stats: 32 GS, 19-3, 1.66 ERA, 200 KsESPN says: Greinke led the majors in win percentage (.865) and WHIP (0.84) while recording a 1.66 ERA, the lowest by a big league pitcher since Hall of Famer Greg Maddux notched a 1.63 in 1995. The Diamondbacks rewarded him with a $206.5 million contract, and now he'll have the honor of matching up against former Dodgers teammate Clayton Kershaw and San Francisco's Madison Bumgarner in what many expect to be a spirited three-team race in the NL West. -- CrasnickBy the numbers: Greinke led all of baseball with a 1.66 ERA last season. That mark was the second best in a single season by any Dodgers pitcher -- from a franchise that has Kershaw, Sandy Koufax, Orel Hershiser and Don Drysdale to its name. Greinke's 2.30 ERA since 2013 trails only that of former teammate Kershaw. He gave up one run or less in 21 of his starts in 2015, the most by any pitcher in a single season since Bob Gibson in 1968. The only pitchers in the past 100 seasons to record more such starts in a season are Gibson, Koufax, Dean Chance and Pete Alexander. In June and July, Greinke posted a 45 ⅔-innings scoreless streak, which the Elias Sports Bureau noted was the sixth longest in MLB history. From the beginning of Greinke's streak on June 18 through the day it ended, 479 different pitchers gave up a run. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information7. Josh DonaldsonJon Blacker/MLB Photos via Getty ImagesPos.: 3B | Team: Toronto Blue Jays | @BringerOfRain202015 rank: 25 | 2016 fantasy rank: 52015 stats: .297 BA, .939 OPS, 41 HRs, 123 RBIsESPN says: Maybe it wasn't the Trade of the Century, but it was certainly the Trade of the Year, as Donaldson won MVP honors after blasting 41 home runs and leading the AL in runs and RBIs. He has finished fourth, eighth and first in the past three AL MVP votes, and considering Toronto's lineup returns intact, he should post monster numbers again. -- SchoenfieldBy the numbers: Donaldson, who uses \"Bringer of Rain\" in his Twitter handle, brought on plenty of rain in 2015. His 41 home runs tied Mike Trout's total for fifth in MLB. Donaldson also led the AL with 123 RBIs and led MLB with 122 runs scored. He is also strong with the glove, which creates an extremely valuable player. He has 24.2 WAR the past three seasons, second in MLB to Trout (26.5). -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information8. Giancarlo StantonTom Szczerbowski/Getty ImagesPos.: RF | Team: Miami Marlins | @Giancarlo8182015 rank: 4 | 2016 fantasy rank: 82015 stats: .265 BA, .952 OPS, 27 HRs, 67 RBIsESPN says: He might not be this sport's finest hitter, but Stanton is clearly this sport's finest rocket-launcher. Only six baseballs left anyone's bat traveling 118 mph or faster last year, according to Statcast, and Stanton hit five of them. Over the past five seasons, Stanton has pounded 29 home runs estimated to go 450 feet or farther. No one else has hit more than 13. Now combine that human-highlight-reel mix with a new hitting coach named Barry Bonds, and stir. Sounds combustible! -- Jayson Stark, ESPN.com senior writerBy the numbers: Stanton has hit 181 home runs since he debuted in 2010, which ranks seventh in MLB. The difference for Stanton is his 181 home runs have come in 2,567 at-bats, more than 300 fewer than anyone above him on the homers list. In his career, Stanton has hit a home run every 14.2 at-bats, which is second only to Jose Bautista in that span. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information9. Jake ArrietaAl Bello/Getty ImagesPos.: RHP | Team: Chicago Cubs | @JArrieta342015 rank: NR | 2016 fantasy rank: 162015 stats: 33 GS, 22-6, 1.77 ERA, 236 KsESPN says: You won't find a more confident player in baseball than Arrieta, and his 2015 season backed him up. He overtook Zack Greinke in the final months to capture his first Cy Young award. He got stronger while others weakened. Maybe that had something to do with his infamous workout routine, which is starting to rub off on his teammates. Arrieta will need that kind of fitness in 2016, as last year's workload finally got to him in the playoffs, and his velocity dipped. But the catcher's glove is popping again this spring, and hitters in the box have been paralyzed at the sight of his devastating breaking pitches. Arieta is ready for a command performance.-- Jesse Rogers, ESPN.com Cubs reporterBy the numbers: Arrieta stepped up his game in the second half last season and posted a 0.75 ERA. Per the Elias Sports Bureau, that is the lowest second-half ERA by a qualified pitcher since the All-Star Game was founded in 1933. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information10. Miguel CabreraMark Cunningham/MLB Photos via Getty ImagesPos.: 1B | Team: Detroit Tigers | @MiguelCabrera2015 rank: 6 | 2016 fantasy rank: 182015 stats: .338 BA, .974 OPS, 18 HRs, 76 RBIsESPN says: It's easy to run out of superlatives when trying to describe the offensive prowess of the 32-year-old slugger. Cabrera, a two-time AL MVP, remains one of the most feared (and revered) hitters in the game. He managed to snag his fourth batting title last season, even while hampered by injury. Beyond his prolific production, Cabrera's underrated defensive skills, superb baseball IQ and infectious enthusiasm for the game make him one of the most captivating players to watch. -- Katie Strang, ESPN.com Tigers reporterBy the numbers: Cabrera played 119 games last season, his fewest in a season since he was a rookie in 2003. However, Cabrera was his usual self when healthy, as his .338 batting average led MLB, and his .440 on-base percentage was tops in the American League. Cabrera has won the AL batting title in four of the past five seasons and has led the AL in on-base percentage three times in that span. -- ESPN Stats \u0026 Information FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcommentSponsored Headlines Comments ","title":"BBTN 100: Players ranked 10 to 1","url":"http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/page/2016BBTN100_10-1/players-ranked-10-1","instanceID":{"$oid":"582f036e208ce3287d510863"},"type":"html"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"582f03a0208ce3287d51087e"},"document":"Updated: April 2, 2013, 8:54 PM ET Recommend0 Tweet0 Comments0Email PNC Park leads ballpark rankings By Jim CapleESPN.comArchive Adam Rubin/ESPNNewYork.comThe Pirates have had trouble fielding a winning team, but their ballpark, PNC Park, is among the best. I've been to every current stadium in the majors and 50 overall (one more than Jamie Moyer!). Aside from personal opinion, my rankings are based on a loose combination of architectural design, surrounding scenery, history, fan friendliness, comfort, sightlines, food, scoreboards and how the stadium fits into the city and neighborhood overall. Note: With so many great new stadiums, even a lower ranking doesn't mean the ballpark isn't a good place to watch a game. Rank Ballpark 1 PNC Park -- The Pirates haven't done much right in past 20 years but give them credit for this, a perfect blend of location, history, design, comfort and baseball. Could not be more beautiful if Frank Lloyd Wright and Ray Kinsella had teamed on the design. 2 Fenway Park --  Close your eyes in this century-old cathedral of baseball history and you can almost see Babe Ruth on the mound, Ted Williams at the plate and Yaz in front of the Green Monster. Still a model for how a ballpark should look after 100 years. 3 AT\u0026T Park -- Cozy and intimate, with the best view in San Francisco since fans could watch Willie Mays in his prime. And best of all, Giants paid for it themselves. 4 Camden Yards -- Twenty years later, the gorgeous first retro-park figures to stand the test of the time even longer than a Cal Ripken playing streak. 5 Target Field -- From its location at the edge of downtown to the wild rice soup in the concession stands, the only way this place could say Minnesota any better is if Garrison Keillor was the PA announcer. 6 Wrigley Field --  Baseball's own little Time Machine to remember what the game used to be like, way back when the Cubs still went to an occasional World Series. 7 Comerica Park -- Filled with beer halls, a merry-go-round and a Ferris wheel, this is as colorful and welcoming as a state fair -- and I would put my money on Justin Verlander knocking down all the milk bottles in the midway with one fastball. 8 Dodger Stadium -- Don't think the Dodgers are really worth $2 billion? Maybe not, but on some evenings, with the sun soaking the San Gabriel Mountains, a seat here will make you reconsider that. 9 Angel Stadium -- Now that Albert Pujols is at first, this gives Disneyland an even more serious run for the money as the happiest place in Anaheim. 10 Safeco Field -- Located just down the road from Fenway Park (well, make that 3,000 miles down I-90), this is perhaps the most accessible, fan-friendly park in the majors. The only thing missing is a view of Mount Rainier (or Ken Griffey Jr in center field).   11 Coors Field -- This is a lovely brick structure in a dynamic downtown neighborhood with plenty of parking, distant views of the Rockies (the mountains), better views of the Rockies (the baseball team) and a brewpub that creates the finest beer you can drink at a ballpark until a team starts playing at a Trappist monastery in Belgium. 12 Kauffman Stadium -- Remodeling Kauffman Stadium was like sending Angelina Jolie to a plastic surgeon: completely unnecessary but a nice effort nonetheless. 13 Citizens Bank Park -- Cozy with the wonderful Ashburn Alley concession area, not even Philly fans can complain about this park. 14 Petco Park -- You can't walk around the ballpark without having your view frequently obstructed, which the Franciscan Order of Ballpark Architects should deem a mortal sin for any stadium. But the architecture and fish tacos make up for that. 15 U.S. Cellular Field -- One of the best kept secrets is that the ballpark on Chicago's south side is pretty damn nice, too. Much improved from when it opened, the ballpark is easily reached via the red line, there are excellent concession areas and best of all, it has a world championship banner from this century. 16 Turner Field -- Carl Lewis won his final Olympic gold medal here in the 1996 Olympics before the stadium was converted nicely to baseball. There aren't too many ballparks where Lewis performed, and given his form when throwing out a first pitch (or singing a national anthem), the fewer ballparks he performs in, the better. 17 Progressive Field -- I like everything about this place except for the three levels of luxury suites that run foul pole to foul pole in an unofficial tribute to the 1 percent. 18 Busch Stadium -- No more view of Pujols but still a great view of the Gateway Arch, lots of beautiful red brick and more statues than in Rodin's studio. 19 Citi Field -- It's way better than Shea, though that's a pretty low bar. A good stadium, but it needs to celebrate the Mets more and the Brooklyn Dodgers less. 20 Minute Maid Park -- I like this stadium because it feels like an athletic arena, not a shopping mall. 21 Rangers Ballpark in Arlington -- It's a good park, but its urban architecture feels out of place for the location and the office buildings in center are a drawback. Who wants to see the office when you're away from the office? 22 Yankee Stadium -- It's big and grandiose, the way Yankee Stadium should be. But despite the careful detail to match old Yankee Stadium, it feels way too much like a shopping mall with a ballpark attached to it. 23 Chase Field -- It's not bad, but it's also the only stadium that is inferior to its home team's spring training site. 24 Miller Park -- It reminds me too much of an airport terminal, with no flights to the World Series. And why doesn't Bernie Brewer slide into a beer mug anymore? 25 Great American Ball Park -- It fails to take full advantage of its riverfront location, has a sterile, metallic feel and the design simply lacks creativity. But it's still way better than Riverfront. 26 Marlins Park -- When the roof is open, it ranks much higher. Unfortunately, the plan is for the roof to be closed most games. Like a Cuban sandwich, it has good local flavor but it also lacks almost any baseball reference/history anywhere other than in the luxury suite levels. 27 Nationals Park -- It's a nice place to watch a baseball game -- especially if you have a Washington lobbyist paying for everything. The best seats are the cheapest: high up the left-field line, with a view of the Capitol. 28 Oakland Coliseum -- This used to be one of my favorite ballparks,  but the Raiders completely ruined it by removing all the charm and replacing it with Mount Davis in center field. 29 Rogers Centre --  They built this just before the start of the retro-park craze. Too bad they didn't wait a few years.  30 Tropicana Field -- Tampa-St. Pete built this in the late '80s to tempt other major league teams to move here. No wonder none did.

HAPPY 100TH, FENWAY I hope Fenway Park lasts to celebrate a second full century in baseball. Although I shudder to think what ticket and beer prices could be there in 2112. Fenway Park opened 100 years ago April 20, and it's still the model for what a baseball stadium should look like. Ever since Camden Yards opened in 1992, teams have blackmailed taxpayers into spending billions of dollars for lavish, new stadiums, many of them designed to remind fans precisely of old parks such as Fenway, which was built in less than seven months and without public financing. • Complete Caple story » 100 years » CELEBRATE TIGER STADIUM Fenway Park's 100th birthday was marked by more than 200 returning Red Sox players and 37,000 fans, the Yankees and Red Sox wearing 1912-era uniforms, at least a dozen books dedicated to the stadium, a commemorative magazine published by the Hall of Fame, a national broadcast and a special musical theme scored by famed composer John Williams. Tiger Stadium's 100th anniversary that same day, however, was commemorated by 200 or so loyal fans gathering over the course of the day at what remains of the beloved old park -- the field, the flagpole, an entry gate -- at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull. • Complete Jim Caple story » CHAVEZ RAVINE'S 50TH Mike Downey counts down his favorite moments --  and they're not all about baseball -- while calling on a few eyewitnesses along the way. • Top 50 Dodger Stadium moments » BALTIMORE'S BEAUTY Click on photo for Camden Yards gallery When a gleaming new stadium called SkyDome opened in Toronto in September 1989, Larry Lucchino, then the president of the Baltimore Orioles, walked across the artificial turf, gazed at the retractable roof, gawked at the hotel that rises above center field and stared at the monstrous video screen that seemed the size of a football field. Awestruck, he said, \"They built the eighth wonder of the world. We're just building a nice little ballpark.\" That nice little ballpark -- Oriole Park at Camden Yards -- is now 20 years old. And Lucchino was right: It's no SkyDome (now called Rogers Centre). It is better, in its own way, than any ballpark, magnificent in its understated, comfortable, cool sort of way. • Complete Tim Kurkjian story » INSIDE MARLINS PARK Call me crazy, but doesn't it defeat the purpose of a retractable roof if you keep it closed?

(2:17)FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcomment2:55 AM ETSam MillerFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailprintcommentIn 2010, after years of rewarding the pitcher with the most wins, Cy Young voters gave the award to Felix Hernandez. The Mariners ace had gone 13-12, and the vote was celebrated by many as a victory not just for the King but for the voting process in general. The tyranny of wins was dead. The Baseball Writers' Association of America, whose members vote on the award, had leapt into the modern ways of evaluating players. Our November tradition of tearing apart the down-ballot selections of baseball writers was, mercifully, over.And then the next six American League Cy Youngs went to the league leader in pitcher wins, including Rick Porcello this week. Just goes to show you ... something.On Thursday, Mike Trout won his second AL MVP award. This is the outcome I had hoped for: The best player won the award that most closely corresponds to the question, \"Who was the best player?\" It's the outcome that the BBWAA had avoided in three of the previous four seasons, when Trout was (by Wins Above Replacement, and in all three of the most prominent public models of it) the best player in baseball but the runner-up in MVP voting. The lone year he won -- 2014 -- has been the exception that proves the rule, as Trout led the league in RBIs and played on a division champion. He was the best player in baseball, too, but it didn't feel like he won that one because he was Mike Trout, you fools.Mike Trout can afford to smile -- he's not a runner-up again in American League MVP voting this time around. Elsa/Getty ImagesIn the same way that Felix Hernandez's Cy Young was supposed to mean something, Mike Trout finally winning an MVP award without any of the usual crutches of default MVP voting will seem to mean something. Resist that conclusion. This is not about the voters, and it is not about us. It's about Mike Trout, the greatest player you've ever seen, and his very good year, and a decision made by 30 men and women that is worth celebrating because it might not happen again.Voters have been struggling with what an MVP is since just about the very beginning. The MVP award was launched in a series of fits and starts, under various aegises and rules, just over a century ago. By the mid-1920s, sports-section readers could already count on columnists making a case for some player and struggling with the ambiguity in the name of the award itself. In 1927, Bob Ray of the Los Angeles Times took a shot at defining it through the lens of one candidate:Gehrig is a good guess, all right, but don't entirely overlook Signor Antonio Lazzeri, who also cavorts on the Yankee infield. Lazzeri's all-around play has been one of the features of the season and his ability to fill in at any of the infield berths is one reason why the Yankees are so far out in front.The attributes that Ray laid out included: utility (Lazzeri played a bunch of positions after teammates went down); clutchness (\"Lazzeri has rapped most of his four baggers when they meant the ball game, one of them coming with the bases full\"); marketable Italianness (\"Lazzeri packs in the Italian fans wherever the Yankees play\"); and outstanding defense (\"fielding has been so phenomenal that eastern critics are pronouncing him 'Another Lajoie'\").In 1932, Grantland Rice argued that the underheralded second baseman Charlie Gehringer deserved consideration:One of the most self-effacing stars in baseball, Charlie Gehringer, is the punch in the Tigers' attack and he's being nominated as the most valuable player in the junior league. What has Gehringer got that permits him to be mentioned in the same breath with Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth of the Yanks, and Joe Cronin of the Senators, who have been rated the key men of the American League?What, indeed. Rice mentions \"the knack for timely hitting,\" \"caring less about winning the batting championship than hoisting the Detroit team into a preferred position,\" \"superbly graceful (play) around the keystone sack,\" playing a demanding infield position and being smart in scouting opponents.In 1928, the Times made the case for Burleigh Grimes, who was an underdog to Jim Bottomley of the front-running Cardinals:There is no question that Burleigh's presence on their team has inspired the Pirates. In the spring, when all the pitchers with the exception of Grimes were going bad, the team appeared listless and downhearted. There were games when they were worse than the hopeless Phillies. Now they look like one of the best teams in the league. They never would have threatened to climb out of the second division if Battling Burleigh hadn't been plugging for them.... What a man!From the beginning, there was an admirable effort put into understanding the entirety of the ballplayer's contribution, and valuing those things that the ballplayers and ballclubs themselves valued. There was also, arguably, a tendency for writers to talk themselves into some terrible positions, such as \"Tony Lazzeri for MVP\"; hitting .373/.474/.765, as Gehrig did in 1927, or .364/.469/.749, as Jimmie Foxx did in 1932, might also help us define \"value.\" (Each won the MVP award.) But, presumably, Ray and Rice didn't discount those gaudy slash lines. They just aimed to make the case that a successful ballplayer often does things that didn't, as they say, show up in the box score.Editor's PicksHow Mike Trout earned AL MVP on a sub-.500 teamSome thought Mookie Betts would win, but Trout's great season for the 74-88 Angels earned him MVP. How did he deliver the most value to get the award?Mookie Betts had an age-23 season for the, um, agesThe only players to post a higher WAR at age 23 than the Red Sox right fielder? Willie Mays, Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins and Cal Ripken Jr.The best of Trout and Bryant in 2016Kris Bryant and Mike Trout are the fourth pair of players under 25 years and under to win MVP2 RelatedWhat the award was never meant to be was a leaderboard sort. Indeed, it was the very opposite of a leaderboard sort: The first MVP award was designed to replace the batting crown, which had been turned into a farce on the final day of the 1910 season when Nap Lajoie was allowed to bunt his way past Ty Cobb thanks to, shall we say, an anti-Cobb bias among players. As The Bill James Historical Abstract puts it, \"After this it was realized that it was not advisable to make such an award contingent directly on player statistics, a principle still recognized today. Instead, the Chalmers company decided to base its award -- the automobile-- upon a poll of sportswriters.\"The ambiguity about who should win the award, a concept so abstract that it would itself inspire a century of debate, is not, then, an accident. It's part of what makes the award fun, part of what makes it memorable, part of why players care about winning it more than they care about leading the league in WAR or any other stat. We have a basic faith in the idea of a group of people coming together with their individual perspectives on the world and voting their consciences. We believe that this is how some large truth emerges that an algorithm or a scientist can't engineer. By one way of considering the voting, there is no such thing as a bad vote that is submitted in good faith.The cost of this faith, of course, is that we'll hate the results much of the time -- especially now that we have an actual leaderboard that attempts to measure value itself. And concluding that Mike Trout is the most valuable baseball player in the world should be one of the easiest decisions an MVP voter gets to make in his or her life.It is certainly about time that Trout won a second award. There is no credible argument that would suggest Trout isn't the best player in his league, or that he wasn't this year.Over his five-year career, he has led the AL in Wins Above Replacement five times. You go to a different site than I do for your Wins Above Replacement? No problem: He leads the AL in all five years regardless of whether you're looking at Baseball-Reference, FanGraphs or Baseball Prospectus. His cumulative WAR, on Baseball-Reference, is nearly two full Mike Trout seasons better than the next best major leaguer in that time period, Robinson Cano. His cumulative WAR in those five years is greater than Manny Machado and Anthony Rizzo combined. It's as great as Jose Altuve, Yoenis Cespedes and Eric Hosmer combined. It's as great as Justin Upton, Chris Davis, Kendrys Morales and Mark Trumbo combined. Only two players in post-integration history -- Willie Mays and Barry Bonds -- have ever produced a better five-year run than Trout has produced in his first five-year run. He is, through age 24, the greatest player in baseball history. We're not talking about a great player, a generational player, another in a line of establishment superstars. We're talking about something that history has never seen, and it's happening right now, in front of us, every day -- and the continued runner-up finishes suggested we were missing it.Mike Trout's performance should have us thinking about how many records he might shatter, not just how many MVP awards he already deserves. Rick Osentoski/USA TODAY SportsHis 2016 season was as good as any of the previous four. He matched a career high for OPS, set new ones for walks and on-base percentage, remembered after two quiet baserunning seasons that he's a top-tier base stealer, and by some advanced metrics had the best defensive season he has had since he was a rookie. His 10.6 WAR on Baseball-Reference is nearly equal to his best ever, and is a mark that only seven other human beings have accomplished since integration.What will Mike Trout accomplish in his career? Very little is off the table. Through age 24, he has the seventh-most home runs ever, with exactly twice as many as Barry Bonds had and 28 more than Hank Aaron did at that age. He's 13th in hits, with a 400-hit head start on Pete Rose. He's seventh in runs, 15th in runs batted in, sixth in total bases, fifth in extra-base hits, fourth in times on base. He is building a career that might demolish records and define our memories of an entire generation of baseball.You would like to think we'll have no fuzz on those memories, but the truth is that these awards go a long way to how we define and remember a career. Big round numbers do, too, but those numbers are affected by so many things that are hard to account for in our heads a half-century later: the run-scoring environment of the era, the ballpark he played in, for instance, but more than that. In 50 years, who even knows which stats we'll look at, or what we'll value in a player. There's a pretty good chance we'll be measuring \"modern\" players in the future using data that don't even exist yet for Trout, and that we can't go back to collect retroactively. What we will have, what will be permanent, are these annual assessments by the BBWAA. And in a just world, Mike Trout, just a couple months past his 25th birthday, would already have five MVP awards. You would care to see that.Two, at least, is better than one. It's a victory worth celebrating.But I'm skeptical it's a victory any broader than that. Late last month, the players voted on Sporting News MLB Player of the Year. Their winner was Jose Altuve. Mookie Betts finished second, followed by David Ortiz, Kris Bryant, Daniel Murphy and finally Mike Trout. Five players on contending teams, who all helped their team win or stay close to a division crown, ahead of Trout, whose team played for nothing. That has been one of Trout's challenges in winning the MVP award, before this year: He hasn't been playing on postseason teams, and some years, for some players, some voters decide that's important. But that's the MVP award. Notice what's missing in the Sporting News MLB Player of the Year Award name? The word value. The voters for this award decided five other major leaguers played better than Mike Trout because they just didn't care enough to get it right.This year's MVP voters did care enough to get it right, or, at least, the definition they chose for \"most valuable player\" corresponded to my definition. Those voters, though, total 30. There are more than 700 active BBWAA members. In a sample of less than 5 percent of members, by an extremely thin margin, voters chose Mike Trout. It's hardly a radical realignment of values. Scramble the members up, have them vote again, and it's quite possible Trout would have finished second or third, again.This is OK! Trout's legacy is bolstered by the hardware, but it is not so fragile as to depend on these votes. Honus Wagner's career almost entirely predated the MVP award, and he never won one. Babe Ruth played in an era when players were allowed to win it only once, and so he won it only once. Willie Mays led National League hitters in WAR 10 times but won only two awards. Are any of these careers underrecognized by history? Do you know anybody who doesn't know what Babe Ruth represented? Can you find anybody who lived through Willie Mays' career who would tell you that he was underappreciated even then?Trout might deserve 15 of these in his career.

The Yankees are kicking in $5.5 million of the $17 million McCann will make in each of the next two seasons.\"It had to be the right fit,\" McCann said on a conference call. \"It wasn't going to be just anywhere.\"The Astros' busy day also included the signing of free-agent outfielder Josh Reddick to a deal that is reportedly for four years and worth $52 million. In Reddick, the Astros get a steady glove in right field, who in 155 combined games last season between the A's and Dodgers hit .281 with 17 doubles, 10 home runs and 37 RBIs.McCann is a seven-time All-Star, but his playing time diminished in the second half of the season as rookie Gary Sanchez emerged as a power hitter behind the plate. Sanchez hit 20 home runs in just 53 games.The 32-year-old McCann hit .242 with 20 homers and 58 RBIs this year.Editor's PicksSource: Reddick goes to Astros for 4 years, $52MThe Houston Astros and free-agent outfielder Josh Reddick have agreed on a four-year, $52 million contract, according to multiple reports.Astros' offseason blasts off with additions of McCann, ReddickThe Astros are aiming high, trading for catcher Brian McCann while signing outfielder Josh Reddick. Will the moves propel them past the Rangers?1 Related\"We entered the offseason with the acquisition of a catcher as a primary focus,\" Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow said in a statement.\"Brian McCann is a great fit for the Astros as he is not only a good defensive catcher, he is also a left-handed hitter with proven run-producing ability,\" Luhnow said. \"His experience and his ability to impact his teammates will be a significant benefit to our team.\"Jason Castro made the most starts at catcher for the Astros last year, batting .210 with 11 homers and 32 RBIs.Houston and the Yankees met in the AL wild-card game in 2015, but neither team reached the playoffs this year.McCann made his big league debut with the Braves in 2005. He hit 24 homers the next year and has hit at least 18 home runs in every season since then.McCann has 245 career homers with 888 RBIs while batting .266.The Yankees signed Brian McCann in the winter before the 2014 season for five years and $75 million, with a full no-trade clause. McCann, a seven-time All-Star, is in the fourth year of the contract. Jonathan Daniel/Getty ImagesThis was McCann's third season in New York after signing an $85 million, five-year deal as a free agent. The Yankees had a $15 million option for 2019 with no buyout.\"I wanted to catch every day,\" he said. \"I feel like I still have a lot of good years left.\"McCann likes what he sees in the Astros, praising \"a lot of great young pieces.\"\"I wanted to be a part of it,\" he said.The 21-year-old Abreu was a combined 3-8 with a 3.72 ERA for two teams in Class A. The 20-year-old Guzman was a combined 3-4 with a 4.05 ERA with two rookie-level teams.The Yankees signed McCann in the winter prior to the 2014 season, with a full no-trade clause. McCann is entering the fourth year of the contract.The deal includes a vesting option that, in theory, he will now have a better chance of achieving. If McCann has a total of 1,000 plate appearances combined in 2017-18 and he plays 90 games at catcher in 2018, while avoiding the disabled list, he would add another $15 million for 2019.With the Yankees, it would seem unlikely he would reach those goals, unless Sanchez underperformed or were injured. With McCann gone, the Yankees have catchers Austin Romine and Kyle Higashioka as possible backups to Sanchez on the 40-man roster.Information from The Associated Press, and ESPN's Buster Olney and Andrew Marchand was used in this report.

(1:26)FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcomment12:53 PM ETESPN.com news services FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailprintcommentAfter putting the Curse of the Billy Goat out to pasture, Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts is looking to make peace with another one of the historical \"ghosts\" that have haunted the team over the years.Having ended the Cubs' 108-year World Series championship drought, Ricketts now wants to contact Steve Bartman.\"It was just so important for this organization to put this lovable loser crap to bed,\" Ricketts told USA Today Sports on Wednesday. \"... We had to get past that and put that in the history of the Cubs, and not the future. We changed that dialogue, and now, it's all a thing in the past.\"Bartman was vilified by some in Chicago for attempting to catch a ball above outfielder Moises Alou along the wall in left field during Game 6 of the 2003 National League Championship Series between the Cubs and Marlins. Bartman made contact but didn't catch it, and neither did Alou, who would have made the second out in the eighth inning but instead jumped up and down in frustration. The Cubs fell apart and lost that game and also Game 7.\"At the right time,\" Ricketts said of his plan to contact Bartman. \"I'm sure we'll figure something out that provides closure for everybody. Hopefully, we can make it work.\"I never focused on ghosts or curses or Bartman or any of that stuff. ... We wanted to eventually get to that point where we can pick out rings ... and here we are.\"Frank Murtha, a lawyer who has served as Bartman's spokesman, told USA Today that Bartman still lives and works in the Chicago area. Bartman has not conducted any interviews since the 2003 incident.\"[Bartman] was just overjoyed that the Cubs won, as all the Cubs fans are,\" Murtha said after the Cubs clinched the title.

This is just another factor in the McCann trade talks with the biggest being he has a full no-trade clause.

St. Lucie County is due to pay 53 percent of that construction cost, with the Mets picking up 35 percent and the state of Florida 12 percent, according to the announcement. The project, which may begin next spring, includes new major and minor league clubhouses, a new practice field, connector for fans around the outfield at Tradition Field, and a Little League/softball complex. share Jake Roth/USA Today Sports3dAdam RubinA glass case of emotion: Mets and their fans will miss Bartolo ColonFor his on-field contributions, his mentoring and his entertainment value at the plate, newest Atlanta Brave Bartolo Colon leaves a void in Queens.

Gary Sanchez is face of YankeesNew York Yankees3dAndrew MarchandChris Davis' drop-off not as sour as it seemsChris Davis isn't likely to get any MVP votes. But there's a fine line between good years and not-so-good ones. We play our own version of \"Candy Crush\" to get a taste of what went wrong for the Orioles slugger. AP Photo/Jae C. HongFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcommentNov 17, 2016Sam MillerFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailprintcommentPlayers have good years, bad years and in-between years, and in 2016 Chris Davis had an in-between year. He was a productive major leaguer, worth a lineup spot on a good team. But he will most likely be named on no MVP ballots this week, after finishing 14th in voting a year ago and third two years before that. Taken together it's all OK, except that Davis was playing the first year under a $161 million contract that will almost assuredly take him into that phase of his career where they're eventually all bad (and expensive) years. The Baltimore Orioles needed this one to be good.As teams prepare this month to sign players to new $161 million contracts (or thereabouts), it's worth looking at what makes for an in-between season. In one sense, Davis' drop-off from 2015 to 2016 is remarkable: By OPS+, Davis (at 107) was more similar to Erick Aybar (at 69) than he was to the 2015 version of himself (147). In another sense, the margins between superstar and expensive, average player are slim enough to straddle.To appreciate this, don't think of a season as a single product, built in a factory somewhere and rolled out to the marketplace in its final form. It is a series of hundreds of individual events, each one with the potential to be good, bad or in-between. Consider it, in fact, like this:Davis' 2015 season, in candy. Sam Miller/ESPNThat's what we're calling Chris Davis's 2015 season, his good season. That's the jar of dry black beans, unpopped popcorn, gummy fish, gummy half-fish, mini marshmallows, knockoff M\u0026Ms, semi-sweetened chocolate chips and unshelled pistachios that we're going to literally unpack today.A new sweetness scale for sabermetricians? Sam Miller/ESPNWithin that jar are the 47 gummy fish, 31 halved gummy fish, 66 knockoff M\u0026Ms, 84 marshmallows and eight chocolate chips that Davis delivered in 2015. These are all delicious treats, and they are all excellent outcomes for a hitter. Within that jar are also 208 uncooked black beans, 214 unpopped corn kernels, and six pistachios. These are bad outcomes for a hitter, and no matter how many home runs a major leaguer can realistically hit, he's going to fill the spaces in between with outs. As Chris Davis did.So Davis went from a near-MVP season to a merely OK season, but not everything changed. For instance, he was hit by exactly as many pitches in both years, so the Orioles got just as many chocolate chips as they might have expected. He grounded into exactly as many double plays, so the Orioles got just as many of those as they have expected. If the Orioles were paying Davis to get hit by pitches, and avoid double plays -- and, in some fractional way, they were -- they would have considered him just as good in 2016 as in 2015. Since HBPs and GIDPs were a wash, let's remove those 14 outcomes from the season, because to the extent that Davis failed to repeat his excellent 2015 season, it happened in the other 650-plus outcomes.Our new jar, free of pistachios and chocolate chips:The jar is still more than half-full ... Sam Miller/ESPNHe drew four more walks in 2016, so to the extent the Orioles were paying him to walk (and they were) they got more than their money's worth. He had six fewer singles, so to the extent they were paying him to single (and they were), they almost got their money's worth. Davis repeated all of the walks and most of the singles, so remove all of the walks from the marshmallows, and all but six of the knockoff M\u0026Ms.He hit 38 homers in 2016, down from 47 in 2015. He doubled 21 times, down from 31. So if the Orioles expected him to hit 78 extra-base hits, he lived up to that promise in 59 of 78 instances. Those 19 missing extra-base hits were, more or less, cleanly replaced by 11 extra strikeouts and five extra outs on balls in play. (He also batted five fewer times.)The difference in Davis from 2015 to 2016. Chew on that. Sam Miller/ESPNWhat got lost in the move remains in the jar; that's the 2015 production that Davis couldn't match. What he replaced it with is in the glass, on the right. We're talking about 20 plate appearances that shifted from positive outcomes to negative, fewer than one bad outcome per week. The overwhelming majority of his nearly 700 plate appearances stayed the same.This is not to diminish the value of those 20 plate appearances. Switching a home run to an out costs a team, on average, more than a run and a half. Switching a double to an out is roughly a run lost, and a single to an out is almost three-quarters of a run. The jar on the left is worth about 25 runs more to the Orioles, or about two and a half wins, which teams are willing to pay around $20 million or more for. This is why Davis won't sniff an MVP vote this year, and it's why Davis gets lumped in with the regrettable signings from last winter.It does, though, stress how little has to actually change for a hitter to go from great to good, or good to bad, or valuable to albatross. That even in big samples, a small subsample can swing everything, for Davis or for any other hitter.You might wonder where those nine homers, 10 doubles and two singles went, and here again we can see how little has to be different for a lot to be different.From the time that the ball was pitched to the moment it was hit, here's what changed for Davis; a bunch of other things stayed more or less the same, and won't be mentioned:Pitchers threw slightly more pitches in the strike zone -- about 45 out of every 100, up from 43 of 100.Davis was much more patient. He swung about five fewer times per 100 pitches seen, a patience that showed up both at pitches in the strike zone and out of the strike zone. He went from the top 40 percent of free-swingers, in 2015, to the bottom 20 percent in 2016. (This probably explains the modest uptick in both walks and strikeouts, as he worked deeper counts.)More teams shifted against him, though not that many more -- he was already shifted by almost everybody. Still, he hit 127 ground balls against an extreme shift in 2016, up from 113 in 2015 (and 96 the year before that). This cost him a single or so.Finally, the direction the ball went changed dramatically. Davis pulled 55 percent of the balls he put in play in 2015, which was the fourth-highest pull rate among all qualifying hitters. He pulled just under 42 percent of balls he put in play in 2016, which is the 62nd-highest pull rate. That was the biggest change in pull rate in the majors this year, by a lot:Pull PositionIn 2016, Chris Davis had the largest dip in pull rate in the majors.RankPlayer20152016Change1Chris Davis55.141.7-13.42Odubel Herrera3627.6-8.43Danny Valencia48.139.7-8.44Starling Marte4638.6-7.45Jose Ramirez44.538.8-5.76Ian Desmond38.733.1-5.67Chase Headley46.541-5.58Jose Bautista56.450.9-5.59Carlos Gonzalez41.836.6-5.210Dustin Pedroia42.837.6-5.2This last bit seems, at first glance, like a major change. And considering how much more power most hitters have when they pull the ball -- the league as a whole slugged .665 on pulled balls this year, .541 on balls hit to center, and just .495 on balls hit the other way -- it seems like the answer for the missing homers and doubles.But, in fact, it explains nothing for Davis, who has had extraordinary power to all fields in his career:Left? Right? Center? Doesn't MatterChris Davis had posted similar, stellar numbers wherever he hits the ball.Davis, CareerAVGSLGTo Right.374.773To Center.401.764To Left.387.775His slugging percentage to the opposite field over the past five years is the best mark in baseball by more than 65 points. Hitting more balls to left or center isn't necessarily a bug for Davis, and in 2016 especially it worked to his benefit: He slugged .975 on balls hit the other way, more than 100 points better than any other hitter in baseball. He slugged .795 on balls hit to center, fifth best in baseball, two points behind Mike Trout.So it wasn't his inability to pull the ball that cost him power. However, it was his inability to pull the ball for power that cost him power. He slugged only .586 when he pulled the ball, his worst power performance on pulled baseballs since 2011, a season he began in Texas. In fact, here is where we find all the missing extra-base hits, and more:Bitter PullChris Davis' lack of power when pulling the ball in 2016 was noteworthy indeed.YearPulled HRPulled 2B2012-14 (Avg)1911201527192016135This despite the fact that his exit velocity on pulled baseballs was, at 91.3 mph, almost identical to his 2015 figure (91.6 mph). His exit velocity on pulled line drives went up, from 97.2 mph to 98.7 mph -- and yet his doubles on pulled liners dropped from 16 to five, and homers from five to two. His average exit velocity on pulled fly balls went up, from 95.7 mph to 99.1, and his average distance on pulled fly balls dropped only from 346 feet to 344; and yet his home runs on pulled fly balls dropped in half, from 22 to 11. Sometimes the park just holds you. Sometimes the defense is just a little bit better.One might still take all these facts and conclude that Davis is in serious and irrevocable decline. Most ballplayers older than 30 are in irrevocable decline, after all, and everything we've noted was different about Davis this year might be used to build in a circumstantial case against him: Pitchers threw him more strikes because they (and their advance scouts) already intuit that he isn't as dangerous as he used to be, maybe. He took more pitches because he realizes that, as he ages, he can't handle as many quality pitches on the edges of the zone, maybe. He pulled fewer pitches because his bat is slower, maybe. He did less damage when he did pull it because he's not as strong, maybe. He dealt with hand soreness throughout the season and said himself that \"I haven't been myself all season.\" His hand kept him from turning the bat over, maybe, or from getting backspin, maybe. Anyway, he struck out more and he hit less. You don't need a jar full of gummy fish to understand that this is what happens to ballplayers sometime after they turn 30.But we, as analysts and baseball fans and GMs signing free agents, miss on veterans almost as often as we miss on young players, because the unknowns about player performance don't go away, they just shift a little. Almost everything Chris Davis did this year was as good as it had been the year before. In a small sliver of his outcomes, sent to just one sliver of the field, everything he hit turned into nothing -- and for no clear or convincing reason. This is one way that a season ends up in the in-between, and it's one way that we are overeager to declare a contract sunk 14.3 percent of the way into it.

Believe it or not, but today I VOTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY ADULT LIFE ON THIS PLANET.  I had plans to drive to Seneca, South Carolina today, but I stayed an extra day in Missouri so I could vote. Missouri doesn't allow early voting, so I had to do an absentee vote. I won't be in Missouri tomorrow, so I was allowed to vote today. What a relief that was to vote for the first time ever in my life. Voting in America is a privilege that we all have as Americans, so please go to the polls and cast your vote.

Should Baltimore Orioles closer Zach Britton have been a finalist in the American League? We asked our experts five questions about the Cy Young Award, and they answered.Who should win and who will win the Cy Young (in AL and NL)?David Schoenfield:  The races are so tightly bunched this year that you can easily make arguments for all the finalists. In the AL, I think Rick Porcello edges out Corey Kluber. Similar ERAs, innings and home runs allowed, and while Kluber had more strikeouts (227 to 189) and fewer hits (170 to 193), Porcello had fewer walks (32 to 57). That kind of breaks out even, and I think Porcello's 22-4 record compared to Kluber's 18-9 will influence enough voters. But I'd go with Kluber.In the NL, it's the lower ERAs of Kyle Hendricks (2.13) and Jon Lester (2.44) versus the 20 wins and 284 strikeouts from Max Scherzer (with a 2.96 ERA). Scherzer also led in Baseball-Reference WAR and was higher than Hendricks/Lester in FanGraphs WAR (Noah Syndergaard and Jose Fernandez ranked 1-2 there). I think Scherzer edges out the two Cubs starters in a close vote. Who should win? See the next question. Insider Become an insider and get access to all our articles and tools.

Box score share Jerry Crasnick ESPN Senior Writer One early takeaway from MLB's Hot Stove market: Starting pitchers who are willing to sign short-term deals are doing quite well financially. Jeremy Hellickson will make $17.2 million with the Phillies in 2017. Charlie Morton got a guaranteed $14 million over 2 years from the Astros after pitching 17 1/3 innings this season, and Atlanta invested $20.5 million in one-year deals for Bartolo Colon and R.A.

If you like closers, you have a few good ones to choose from. But let's face it: You can't build your whole team around a closer; they're the dessert -- not the main course.Editor's PicksTop 50 MLB free agents: Cespedes, Fowler highlight slugger-heavy classThis year's free-agent class is light on top-tier talent and depth, but there's plenty of power to go around, including a few 40-homer guys.Early storylines to follow: Cespedes and Sale on the move?Could some big-name pitchers end up on the trade market? Who is the best free-agent hitter available?  With the Cubs celebrating their title, a busy offseason awaits.1 RelatedBesides the closers, the icy grasp of entropy awaits. Yoenis Cespedes and Justin Turner are nice players, but both are on the wrong side of 30 and unlikely to be superstars, and the quality of free agents drops off immensely after the top handful.That makes this winter a dangerous one for MLB execs. Just because the talent level available is weak doesn't mean the money dries up and baseball is awash in cash. A lot of bucks will be chasing very few prizes, and in such an environment, some noodle-scratcher contracts will come to pass. Stephen Strasburg got a pretty nice contract extension from the Nationals, but I think if he hit free agency under these circumstances, someone might have just given him their team.Below we have the players with the top 25 free-agent valuations, as projected by the ZiPS projection system. This is not necessarily what each player will get paid or what he should expect to get paid, though there's obvious correlation. Rather, these are estimated valuations of what a player's contribution in wins is worth. In other words, this is how much ZiPS says the player is worth. Keep in mind that not every team is concerned with being the most efficient; teams in win-now mode with an obvious hole might rightly overpay to enhance their current core as much as they can.Players are ranked by their average yearly salary, or A.A.V. (average annual value), beginning with the most expensive.1. Justin Turner, 3B Age: 31 | B-T: R/R Years in league: 8 2016 WAR: 4.9ZiPS' projected value: Five years, $107.7 million (A.A.V.: $21.54M)Go back five years, and this would seem to be an odd name to see at the top of such a list. Turner was 26 and showed signs of becoming a journeyman jumping from Triple-A city to Triple-A city, especially after he started at second for the desperate Mets and posted results near replacement level. The Dodgers gave Turner a chance, first as a role player and then as a regular starter, and he didn't disappoint. Turner hit .296/.364/.492 in his three seasons in L.A. for a 136 OPS+. That would be very good for a first baseman, but he isn't one. Although he might be stretched as a shortstop or second baseman, he has proven to be a more than competent third baseman.There will be a lot of money chasing not a lot of talent, and Turner is a rare position player who isn't on the easy side of the defensive spectrum.Declined qualifying offer Insider To see how much Justin Turner, Yoenis Cespedes and other top free agents are worth from a statistical perspective, become an Insider today.

Can he keep it up? Jonathan Daniel/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcommentNov 16, 2016Jeff SullivanSpecial to ESPN.com CloseSenior editor at FanGraphs since 2012.BBWAA member.Founded Lookout Landing in 2005.Has served as the main baseball editor for SB Nation.Follow on TwitterFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcommentOut of everyone who threw enough innings to qualify for the ERA title, no one finished with a lower average than Kyle Hendricks. And, heck, he led MLB by 31 points, which is the same as the difference between Chris Sale and Jerad Eickhoff. Hendricks might get rewarded with the National League Cy Young, but even if he doesn't, he has proven himself, a feather in the cap for everyone who has ever said it's better to be a pitcher than a thrower. If you go back to the Chicago Cubs getting Hendricks from the Texas Rangers in a trade for Ryan Dempster all the way back in 2012, it wasn't just one lopsided trade that helped the Cubs to build a championship rotation.However, Hendricks' 2.13 ERA is worthy of closer examination. Whenever you see any extreme data point, you should ask yourself, how likely is this to repeat? There's no question that Hendricks has become a quality starter. There's no question he's one of the most valuable Cubs, and indeed, one of the more valuable starting pitchers. Yet Hendricks' season was at least partially the result of some extraordinary circumstances. In part, it was about Hendricks. In part, it was about everyone else around him. But it's almost impossible to imagine the same season happening again.Editor's PicksAnd the nominees are: Your guide to MLB's awards weekOK, so maybe baseball's awards season doesn't have all the glitz, glamour and gift bags of the Oscars. But it does have star power. Here's who will win -- and who should win -- this week.To start with some little stuff: Hendricks isn't a contact pitcher, but he's also not a high-strikeout guy. He struck out batters at a rate a couple points higher than average. He also walked batters at a rate a couple points lower than average. Put the rates together and you get K-BB percentage (or K-BB%). Hendricks finished last year at 17 percent, while the average was 13 percent. That makes Hendricks compare well to frequent comp Greg Maddux, but when Maddux ran a K-BB% of 15 percent between 1992-2001, the average was 7 percent. Baseball has changed -- strikeouts are everywhere. Hendricks has a long, long way to go if he wants to be a real Maddux 2.0.Hendricks is good in part because he does get his strikeouts. He's boosted, as well, by the fact that he limits his free passes. But just in terms of K-BB percentage, Hendricks was the same as Julio Teheran and John Lackey. Hendricks thrived because of his timing, and because so many batted balls were turned into outs. Insider Become an insider and get access to all our articles and tools.

(2:17)FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcommentNov 16, 2016Doug PadillaESPN Staff Writer CloseDoug covers the Los Angeles Dodgers for ESPN.com. He joined ESPN Chicago in July 2010 and covered the Chicago White Sox for ESPNChicago.com and ESPN Radio 1000 through the 2015 season.Follow on TwitterFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailprintcommentDave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers has topped Joe Maddon and Dusty Baker to win the National League Manager of the Year Award.After taking over for Don Mattingly this past season, Roberts continued the Dodgers' trend of playoff appearances by guiding the club to a 91-71 record and a fourth consecutive NL West title. The Dodgers have now reached the postseason in four consecutive seasons for the first time in franchise history.\"I think, you know what, it's about the process, and I think this is actually the first day I've had a chance to reflect on what happened from the first day of spring training to now,\" Roberts said. \"And even after the postseason, I didn't really play the season out in my head too much. But I think to set goals, to play every out and try to get better, I think that as a group, as an organization, we did that. Obviously we came up short in the sense of winning a world championship, but I'm just proud of the way our guys battled adversity all year.\"Editor's PicksDave Roberts goes from bullpen maestro to manager of the yearDave Roberts' handling of the Dodgers pitching staff amid a historic number of injuries earned him the National League Manager of the Year Award.Did a rainout cost Cubs' Maddon NL Manager of the Year Award?The Cubs won 103 games, but would more have been in store for Joe Maddon if they hadn't slumped in a 24-game stretch, which included a makeup game?1 RelatedAs much as the team's on-field success defined Roberts' rookie season as a manager, so did the player injuries he was forced to overcome. The Dodgers broke camp in spring training with 10 players on the disabled list, believed to be a record to open a season.It did not get any better for the Dodgers, as 28 players ultimately hit the disabled list, the most players any club has put on the DL in the past 30 seasons. The list of injured players included staff ace Clayton Kershaw, who was lost for 75 days after a back injury in late June.\"Did I expect us to have the injuries that we did? I think when you look at it from that lens, [the season was] more challenging [than expected],\" Roberts said. \"But I think that the support that I had completely exceeded what my anticipation was. The relationship with the front office, the coaches, the way that the players bought into us, made this whole season considerably easier than I anticipated.\"I think the focus on the day-to-day, and not getting even ahead to tomorrow or the next day, made it a lot easier. And I think that at any point of the season, [if] I would have stepped back and looked at the expectation or the injuries, it would have felt daunting, but it never really felt that way, even in late June when we were eight games back.\"Instead of the team collapse that was predicted, the Dodgers turned an eight-game NL West deficit at the time of Kershaw's June 26 injury into a division-title-clinching celebration one week before the regular season was completed. The Dodgers ended up winning the division over the San Francisco Giants by four games.Roberts also gave credit to Terry Francona of the Cleveland Indians, who won the American League Manager of the Year Award. Roberts played for Francona when Francona was Boston's manager.\"He definitely influenced me, and I think that the way he related to players, his relationship to the front office and fans,\" Roberts said. \"To me, the main thing with Tito is that he just let players play, and when you as a coach or manager can empower your players, it goes a long way. From Tito to a lot of different managers and coaches that I've had the great pleasure of being around, helped me form, I guess my managing, I guess, style.\"Roberts becomes just the second Dodgers rookie manager to lead the team into the postseason after Tommy Lasorda in 1977 and only the sixth rookie manager to ever win the award.The Dodgers won 90-plus games for the fourth consecutive season, a feat that had been accomplished just one other time in franchise history, when they won 90-plus games in six consecutive seasons from 1951 to '56.

Gary Sanchez is face of YankeesNew York Yankees3dAndrew MarchandHow do the Marlins move on without Jose Fernandez?After losing their ace in a September tragedy, the Marlins will try to navigate the impossible task of moving on without Jose Fernandez. Steve Mitchell/USA TODAY SportsFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailcommentNov 15, 2016Jerry CrasnickESPN Senior Writer CloseESPN.com senior writer Author of \"License to Deal\" Former Denver Post national baseball writerFollow on TwitterFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailprintcommentThe day after Jose Fernandez died, Michael Hill sat down at his desk, took a deep breath and tended to his first big procedural chore as president of baseball operations for the Miami Marlins. He logged on to the Major League Baseball database, typed the word \"deceased'' next to Fernandez's name and removed him from the team's active roster.The seven weeks since have been a blur of emptiness and obligation for Hill and Miami's front office. The Marlins still grieve daily over the loss of Fernandez, who died Sept. 25 with two companions in a boat crash off the south Florida coast. But Hill and the executives and scouts on his watch are also conscious of their mandate to put the best possible team they can on the field for 2017. The task is exponentially more difficult without Fernandez, who was yanked from their presence without a semblance of a warning.Hill's office at Marlins Park overlooks the West Plaza where the team painted a stadium pillar orange and fans lined up by the hundreds to inscribe messages of love and remembrance in the days after Fernandez's death. Every now and then, a passerby stops to pay respects or take a photo. Then the fan moves on, and Hill is left with a swirl of emotions and the gravity of his mission.\"You never forget the human [side] or what happened, but you know you have a job to do,'' Hill said. \"We're never going to replace Jose, but we have to try to move forward. The memory of him will always be with us and be a part of who we are. That's a bond we'll all have forever.''Fernandez's death came during a time of promise and hope for the Miami organization. A young Marlins roster improved from 71 to 79 victories under first-year manager Don Mattingly, and the pieces were in place to bring continued growth. Right fielder Giancarlo Stanton is one of the game's elite power hitters. Left fielder Christian Yelich just won a Silver Slugger Award at age 24. And the foursome of catcher J.T. Realmuto, shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria, second baseman Dee Gordon and center fielder Marcell Ozuna combine to give the Marlins a strong up-the-middle presence.A position-player core led by Dee Gordon, Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich will be the Marlins' on-the-field strength in 2017. Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY SportsStarting pitching was the tenuous link in the team's chain, with the exception of the stability Fernandez provided every fifth day.In 29 starts in 2016, Fernandez logged a 2.86 ERA with a 1.12 WHIP and 12.5 strikeouts per nine innings. In comparison, Miami's other 12 starters combined for a 4.70 ERA, a 1.44 WHIP and 7.2 strikeouts per nine.The Marlins aren't even entertaining the possibility of trying to \"replace'' Fernandez, because his impact was so profound. If spring training began today, Miami's rotation would consist of Wei-Yin Chen, Adam Conley, Tom Koehler, Justin Nicolino and Jose Urena. Even if the Marlins wanted to sign a big name -- which is typically a foreign proposition for them -- the free-agent market is bereft of front-of-the-rotation arms. The other alternative is a trade, and they lack the talent in their farm system to make a run at Chris Sale, Sonny Gray, Chris Archer or other commonly mentioned alternatives.Miami's top pitching prospects are a ways away. Tyler Kolek, a former first-round pick with a 100 mph fastball, underwent Tommy John surgery in April. Lefty Braxton Garrett, selected out of an Alabama high school with the seventh pick of the 2016 draft, will begin his journey through the minors in the spring. During the Arizona Fall League, the Marlins have been monitoring the progress of starter Jarlin Garcia and reliever Drew Steckenrider. Scouts regard both as future big leaguers, but neither is the type to anchor a staff.With few alternatives, the Marlins have discussed fortifying their staff at the back end to help compensate for the loss of Fernandez's 182 innings. Relievers A.J. Ramos, David Phelps, Kyle Barraclough and Brian Ellington combined for 332 strikeouts in 256⅔ innings this season. If the Marlins can add a power arm or two this winter, they'll have a bullpen that will take some heat off the rotation and allow Mattingly to pick his spots.\"We leaned on our bullpen a lot last year because it was a strength for us, and our starting pitching on the whole wasn't as strong,\" Hill said. \"To build that way is another route we can take. Get versatile, multi-inning pieces in the bullpen and try to shorten a game. We've seen the trends of late with Kansas City and [Cleveland] in the postseason. We have the pieces in place already, so that might be a way to ease the blow.''If Hill is looking for a current road map on how to move past Fernandez on and off the field, none exist. The closest comparable came two years ago in St. Louis, when star outfield prospect Oscar Taveras died in a car accident in his native Dominican Republic at age 22.Taveras' death marked the third encounter with tragedy for St. Louis general manager John Mozeliak in 20 years with the organization. Mozeliak was assistant GM under Walt Jocketty when veteran starter Darryl Kile died of a heart ailment in 2002, and was in the same role when pitcher Josh Hancock was killed in a car accident in 2007.Mozeliak reached out to Hill immediately after Fernandez's death, and the two have spoken several times since. Among the insights Mozeliak has shared: Work can be therapeutic.\"You want to be respectful to the parents and siblings and people in that inner circle who are going to grieve for a long time,'' Mozeliak said. \"But going back to business actually helps with the healing. It's hard to get your hands around a tragedy when you're [forcing yourself] not to think about it. When you have something to focus on -- like getting the club going again from an organizational standpoint -- it makes it a lot easier.''At the time of Taveras' death, he was regarded as an elite prospect still trying to get over the hump. Taveras had just hit .239 with a .590 OPS in 80 games as a rookie, and the Cardinals knew he had some maturing to do and adjustments to make to take his game to another level.The Cardinals were coming off a 90-win season and a National League Central title in 2014, and Mozeliak couldn't afford to stand pat and let things sort themselves out in the spring. So he made a bold offseason move, acquiring right fielder Jason Heyward and reliever Jordan Walden from the Atlanta Braves for pitchers Shelby Miller and Tyrell Jenkins before Thanksgiving. Heyward logged a .293/.359/.439 slash line and won a Gold Glove to help the Cardinals win 100 games in 2015 before leaving to sign a $184 million contract with the Chicago Cubs.\"You felt Jose every fifth day on the mound, and the energy he brought. But this was also a young man who loved life and lived it to the fullest. He had a pure energy and passion for the game that was infectious. I don't think you can separate the two.\"Marlins president of baseball operations Michael Hill\"What the Marlins are doing, and specifically Mike Hill, is a little different than what we were dealing with,'' Mozeliak said. \"He was dealing with the rumors: 'Do we trade Jose Fernandez or try to sign him long term?' Jose had already established himself as one of the elite players at the major league level.\"Not to sound callous or coldhearted, but I remember shortly after Oscar's passing I was reflecting and I said to a few people, 'We're not going to miss him next year from a baseball standpoint. It's going to be two or three or four years down the road, when we don't have the No. 3 hitter we thought we'd have.'\"Left without their ace, the Marlins try to take solace in positive signs. Stanton, Miami's quiet superstar, assumed more of a vocal leadership role in the days after Fernandez's death, and the players and staff grew closer amid painful circumstances. But Fernandez's absence won't truly hit home until the first day of spring training in Jupiter, Florida, when the clubhouse will be a much quieter place.\"You felt Jose every fifth day on the mound, and the energy he brought,'' Hill said. \"But this was also a young man who loved life and lived it to the fullest. He had a pure energy and passion for the game that was infectious. I don't think you can separate the two.''As the Marlins go down an uncharted path this offseason, the memories of Fernandez will simultaneously haunt and sustain them. They're still trying to process the unimaginable, while doing their best to make it through another day.
